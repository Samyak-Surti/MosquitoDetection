# An Intelligent Drone-Based Hierarchical Image Classifier: Defense against Mosquito-Borne Illnesses 

*2017 Science Fair Project*

## Abstract
With a continual threat of mosquitoes carrying deadly diseases such as Zika, Malaria, and Yellow Fever, we as humans have constantly kept our guard up through the use of medical technologies such as vaccines, that have decreased our chances of contracting a disease from these mosquitoes. Why can't we, instead, head straight to the source of these diseases, and find out where these mosquitoes are breeding? By attacking them at their breeding grounds, we can control their diffusion to more populated areas to keep the diseases from spreading along with them. Through the use of a drone-based system that has been trained to recognize mosquitoes and mosquito larvae at their breeding grounds, we can deploy small pellets or a powdered form of Â Bti, an organic and safe insecticide, to kill off the mosquitoes. Through this process, not only can we decrease the population of mosquitoes, but also the population of those carrying a disease, lowering the chances of contracting one by a large amount. My proposal is to employ Artificial Neural Networks, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks, to train a drone offline, using Google's Machine Learning framework Tensorflow, aided by GPU acceleration. My hope is that with this approach, aided by the new technological advancements of today, we can now target very point-specific locations rather than large general areas of mosquitoes to help solve the problem of diseases running rampant worldwide.
